# Setup the Project #

Follow these steps to initialize the project the first time. This documentation
is intended to be a reference to how the project was set up, but not to have to
do it again. However, if you have to do it again, please update this document.

## Tools ##

You will need a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 
Version 14.17.5 LTS was used at the time these instructions were written.

## Steps ##

Use [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
to generate the initial application.

```
npx create-react-app www.desertskyrangers.org
cd www.desertskyrangers.org
npm start
```
