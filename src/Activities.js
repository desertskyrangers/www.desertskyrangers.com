					<h2>{Icons.DESERT_SKY_RANGERS} October 2022 Ranger Rally</h2>
					<p>
						The <a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z3bZu5KKpnuC4vAx9'>October 2022 Ranger Rally</a> was
						held Saturday, October 15 at 9am at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WfuVVZqe4Qv32PX27">{Icons.LOCATION} Wardle Fields Regional Park</a> in
						Bluffdale. We had most of the club members as well as some new
						flyers and spectators. The morning hours were breezy which may
						flying light airplanes a bit tricky. After noon the breeze settled
						down and it felt more comfortable so several of us stays another
						couple of hours to keep flying. Noah won the spot landing challenge
						with a distance of just 13 feet. Well done Noah! We greatly
						appreciate our photographer Steve.

					<h2>{Icons.DESERT_SKY_RANGERS} August 2022 Ranger Rally</h2>
					<p>
						The <a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/1i374x5e5sQRXYBcA'>August 2022 Ranger Rally</a> was held Saturday, August
						13 at 9am at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WfuVVZqe4Qv32PX27">{Icons.LOCATION} Wardle Fields Regional Park</a> in
						Bluffdale. We were fortunate that all members of the club were able
						to attend. We spent several hours together flying, chatting, and
						flying some more. We got some updated club pictures, showed off some
						new aircraft builds. Some of the most fun was doing one of the
						scheduled challenges. Blaine won the gliding challenge by staying
						aloft for 102 seconds with only 15 seconds of climb power. Well done
						Blane! Noah finally got to fly his twin engine flying wing. Hudson
						few his rescue plane Charmane. She unfortunately ended up with a
						broken tail feather. We greatly appreciate our photographers Steve
						and John-Erik. Without them there would have been fewer moments to
						remember.

					<h2>{Icons.RALLY} Jun 2022 Build Day</h2>
					<p>
						On Saturday, Jun 4th we held a <a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/Sd3FaTet7f8DoNpA6'>build day</a> to spend some time building
						several <a href="/plans">DSR-001 aircraft</a>. What started out as a cool breezy day turned
						into a hot breezy day as we worked through taping together plans,
						cutting out parts and using hot glue to assemble aircraft. By the end
						of the day, Noah and Hudson had their first DSR-001 aircraft built.

					<h2>{Icons.RALLY} Feb 2022 Ranger Rally</h2>
					<p>
						We held the Feb 2022 Ranger Rally on Saturday, Feb 12th
						at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WfuVVZqe4Qv32PX27">{Icons.LOCATION} Wardle Fields Regional Park</a>.
						This time we chose to fly in the afternoon which turned out to be
						a great choice because the wind calmed down and the temperatures
						came up to give us fantastic flying weather. Micah brought his dad
						out to fly with us along with a beautiful modified Piper Cub.
						Hudson put in several more flights on his Bixler II and had great
						landings. Noah flew his Bixler and Arrow. Unfortunately the Arrow
						had a spectacular nose-in landing so he will be working on a new
						build soon. Glen brought out several new aircraft. His biplane
						struggled to get off the ground due to the long grass, and even
						then, the flights were nothing more than a hop. His Cronos I had
						its maiden flight and after putting in a 4S battery flew nicely.
						Last, but not least, Holden got one launch with his new rocket.
						We're not sure how high it went but we were glad the parachute did
						not fully deploy so it came down nearby. Apparently we were having
						so much fun flying, we didn't get any photos. All in all, a good
						day!

					<h2>{Icons.RALLY} Jan 2022 Ranger Rally</h2>
					<p>
						We held the <a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/jNU48m2dBRWr3df98'>Jan 2022 Ranger Rally</a> on Saturday, Jan 29th
						at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WfuVVZqe4Qv32PX27">{Icons.LOCATION} Wardle Fields Regional Park</a>.
						It was a cold morning with temperatures just above freezing. Several of us
						got to try out new equipment and aircraft that we received over the
						holidays. Hudson was able to maiden his new Bixler 2. Noah flew his
						rebuilt FliteTest Arrow successfully and we all got a birdseye view from
						Mark's new FPV setup on his Typhoon III. Blaine also joined the fun
						with his Bixler and giant Volantex Ranger 2000.
